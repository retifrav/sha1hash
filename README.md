sha1hash
=========
    
Nothing fancy, just getting SHA1 hashes for files in the specified directory with specified extensions (`.jpg`, `.png` and `.gif`). No one will ever use it, so everything is hardcoded.

![sha1hash main window screenshot](/img/mainwindow.png?raw=true "NWShelper main window screenshot")

3rd party
=========

The application is written in `C#`, `WPF` with `Visual Studio 2013` (if that matters) and `.NET 4.5.1`. Those nasty bastards did all the work, I just wrote a few lines of code.

And I snatched some (all) icons from [Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/).
